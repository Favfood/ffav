       <h4>Donkey's Biography</h4>
     <hr>
   <p> Donkey is first seen with an old lady who was his owner and the two of them, along with other characters, were in a line for people who had fairy tale creatures and they exchange the creatures for money. When she was there, Donkey refused to talk and the knights took her away. Then, Donkey accidentally gets hit by fairy dust from a fairy, (which Peter Pan was taking in to sell) making him fly. <p>
    He exposed himself by talking while flying, but after the few seconds of him flying, it was over and he hit the ground. The knights tackled him, but he was still able to escape from them fast enough and literally bumped into Shrek. Shrek scared the knights away by posing as the giant, and after that, Donkey wanted to be Shrek's friend to repay him. Shrek was annoyed by Donkey, so he tried to scare Donkey away by roaring at him, but Donkey wasn't scared. Donkey told Shrek that he does need a few tic-tacs for Shrek's stinky breath as he followed him to his home.</p>

<p>Donkey pleaded to stay, but Shrek kicked him out, so Donkey stayed outside.</p>


<p>Then, at night, Shrek found many other fairy tale creatures outside his house (besides Donkey). He orders them all to leave, but don't go as they say they were sent there by Lord Farquaad.</p>

<p>So, Donkey and Shrek go to the kingdom of Duloc to confront Farquaad. When they meet him, Farquaad decided that in order for the fairy tale creatures to leave Shrek's swamp, they must rescue a princess (Fiona). So, Shrek and Donkey go to rescue the princess. While Shrek is looking for the princess, Donkey gets chased by a dragon who cornered him on a broken bridge. As the dragon was about to eat him, he smooth-talked her so he would not be eaten, but she fell in love with him and took him to her chambers, shaking her hips back and forth happily as she carries him away. She flirts with him persistently, even though Donkey doesn't show interest, it doesn't stop her. She then puckers her lips and proceeds to attempt to give donkey a smooch causing Donkey to freak out. But at that moment Shrek fell down and got his behind kissed instead. She tried to give chase but failed, if Donkey wouldn't have been rescued Dragon would have likely kept him there forever where she could have kissed him as much as she pleased. During the journey back to Duloc, Shrek stated that there was a donkey named Gabby, who was "small and annoying". This description fits Donkey himself, and the name "Gabby" possibly could be "Donkey". </p>
 
<p>On the way to Duloc, Shrek, Donkey, and Fiona got along well. Even though Donkey was separated from Dragon, he was reunited with her when Donkey, Dragon, and Shrek saved Fiona from marrying Farquaad, who is eaten by Dragon.
